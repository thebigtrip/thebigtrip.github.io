        <p class = "entry-text">Dad Interviewing  Elijah

D:  Hi, Elijah. How’s your week at Credo going?<br><br>

E: Good.<br><br>

D: What have you most enjoyed about Credo?<br><br>

E: The food. The food is really good. <br><br>

D: Anything else?<br><br>

E: They have badminton, ping-pong, and other games.<br><br>

D: Cool. Can you tell everyone what other things we have done this week?<br><br>

E: On Tuesday, we didn’t do any big hiking or have a busy day. We went to some castle ruins near here. They’re very cool and amazing. We read ‘Lord of the Rings’ there for a bit, and had lunch.<br>

 <br><br>

D: You had lunch in castle ruins?<br><br>

E: Yeah, it was really cool. It’s not a really big castle, but it’s decent sized, and we read about it’s history and it was laid siege to a couple times.<br><br> 

D:  What else have you done?<br><br>

E: On Wednesday we hiked up to a place called First, very high up in the mountains. We walked along a bridge walk so you could see the bottom of the cliff far below you.
Mom, Hannah, and Esther went to a playground they saw on the way up. The rest of us, with a friend from Credo, Mr. Greg, hiked up to a lake called Bachalspee.

While we were there we ate our snacks with cows all around us. One walked up to me and tried to eat the banana I was eating.

Oh, I forgot about the goat. On the way to Bachalspee, there were some mountain-breed of goats from somebody’s farm. One of them was “posing” for pictures. People were posing with him, petting him, touching his horns, and so on. Finally, one person went too far and got thumped in the chest by him.  [Not hurt, but people backed off a bit after that]

</a><br><br>

Once we got to the lake, we decided to take a different way down to meet Mom and the girls. It was quite a long hike. When we got back to the station, we hopped in a gondola and rode down to Grindelwald, but just missed the train that they were on, so we had to wait for the next one.<br><br>

Once we got back to Wilderswil, we met Mom and the girls coming back from Credo. There was no supper at Credo that night [the group was having dinner on their outing], so we decided to get food from the grocery store. On our walk back to Credo, it started to rain.<br><br>

It rained very hard and we all got soaked. There was thunder and lightning. It was cool.<br><br>

Yesterday, we went out to a lake near here and went swimming, though it was a little too cold for it. Today, we’re going back to Lauterbrunnen Valley.<br><br>

D: Sounds like a fun week.<br><br>

E: It was a very fun week.<br><br>

D: In less than a week, we’ll be home. How does that sound to you?<br><br>

E: I don’t know. Exciting, maybe. Sad, maybe. I haven’t really tried to think too much about home, just enjoying where we are.<br><br>

        <p class = "entry-text">It’s time we caught you all up, loyal blog-checkers.<br><br> 

Our time at the Granary last week was really good. It was very much on a working farm. Our hosts, Hans and Elena, have about 50 cattle, some fruit trees, goats and chickens.<br><br>  

The first few days were mostly resting with some short walks, reading, games. There was a trampoline the kids enjoyed, and a ping-pong table. They also had an assortment of old bikes, and we were able to find ones that fitted sufficiently and had had the luxury of working brakes that we were able to take a family bike ride. The last few days featured jaunts into Luzerne and then up Pilatus.

</a><br><br>  

On Friday, we did a long day going up Mount Pilatus. A couple of bus rides took us to the gondolas. We took advantage of one stop on the way up to enjoy a very fun playground with a stream, zip line, and tunnels. It was a real hit.<br><br> 

Then gondola rides to the top, including one soaring, majestic ride to the peak. We ate our sandwiches up on the peak, and found a cool spot in a cave to read for a while (continuing our summer reading through ‘The Lord of the Rings’).<a href= "image src here">

The trip down the other side was by cogwheel train, a max of 48 degree descent, looking out on grazing cattle and magnificent views, down to Lake Lucerne. And as we came to the bottom, the heat again. Another day in the 90’s.<br><br>  

The boat took us back to Luzerne, and then a hot bus ride ending with a short walk back to the Grainary. We took cool showers and found places in the shade and had a bite of supper.<br><br> 

And then packed up our things again, ready to move on. Saturday, we made our way to Interlaken where we were picked up at the train station by the helpful people of Credo Castle (www.credo.ch).<br><br> 

Credo is a Christian ministry outside of Interlaken. We were immediately impressed by the friendliness, hospitality, and what a good place this will be. And being further up in the mountains, it is also, thankfully, a bit cooler. There is a German-speaking family week going on here. So lots of families with young kids. We’ve interacted with some of them a bit, but the language-barrier means we’ll mostly keep to ourselves, which is fine. They’ve been very friendly. We take our breakfasts and dinners in the dining hall with this group of roughly 100 people.<br><br>  

On Sunday we made our way to an English-speaking worship service in Interlaken along with another American who is a guest here. It was a good time of worship and fellowship with a few other Americans and others who were mostly British. Around 35 folks gathered for prayer and singing, and sermon focusing on what it means to be “at home” in Christ together. It all seemed very good and fitting as we begin to turn our hearts towards the homeward journey.<br><br> 

But first, a week to enjoy here. Today, we ventured by trains and gondola rides up into Lauterbrunnen Valley. Part of what brought us here is that J.R.R. Tolkien, at age 19, did a walking tour of this area. And years later, as he constructed Middle Earth and the stories we’re reading, he drew on his memories of this place to create a landscape for the journey of the Fellowship. <br><br> 

Today, we had a great day. It is beautiful beyond description. We took some good walks, sat and read for a while, and climbed up to the foot of the highest waterfall in Switzerland (the Murenbach Falls). It’s mist cooled us beautifully and it was thrilling to stand at its base. As we came down, rain clouds moved into the valley. And by the time we got on the bus back, we went through a heavy shower.

We’re now back at Credo, showering and reading. The temperatures after some rain are lovely. Such a good place to be as our Big Trip heads down the “home stretch.” - Darrin<br><br>

	 <p class = "entry-text">We have been told in England, France, and now Switzerland that it is unusually hot and dry. That has made our day trips challenging and tiring. When we were in Paris we looked at the line to go up the Eiffel Tower and said no way. Too long and hot. Instead we went over to the fountains nearby and joined the many people in the cool water. Again, the water refreshed the kids and cooled us down. A lot of fun. </p>

 <p class = "entry-text">There was no spot in the shade for our tents. The adult meeting and food was served in a tent. We usually ate our meals out under a tree hoping for more of a breeze. The kids sat under the tree while we were listening to the speaker. For the meetings, the speaker would say a sentence or so in English and then wait for multiple people to translate it into their own language so people sitting near them could understand what he was saying. Kind of noisy but gave me time to take notes.</p>

After a taxi-train-subway-train-bus trip from Amiens and through Paris, we arrived yesterday afternoon in Taize. 
<br><br>
Let’s get the weather out of the way first - it is hot. 95-100 F yesterday, and today only a couple degrees less. Getting here yesterday in the heat, hauling luggage, setting up tents, etc., was no fun. Today we’re able to manage a bit better. But it’s still hot. Even in the shade. It is, as they say, a “dry heat,” but at some point heat is heat. It’s hot. And that’s a strain on bodies and spirits.
<br><br>
And yet….just getting here is something of an accomplishment and fulfilling a long curiosity and desire. Having heard of this place, having borrowed from its songs and prayers, it’s a joy to see it all in person. If you don’t know anything of Taize, go to their website or Google it. It’s a community of monks (“brothers”) who practice a life and way of prayer, and for decades now have become a gathering place. People come here, young people especially, by the thousands week after week. Living conditions are simple. Everyone helps with chores. And the central gathering point for the whole thing is morning, noon, and evening prayer services - each an hour or more in length with meditative, repeated, songs of prayer as the most prominent feature. 
<br><br>
Just attending the first prayer service last evening was a moving experience. Despite the heat (did I mention the heat?), and sitting on hard floors, here were a couple thousand people, most in their teens and twenties, gathered for Bible readings, sung prayer, and periods of silence. Having heard of this for years, it was a joyful wonder to just sit and take it in. It really exists.
<br><br>
Today we’ve gone to morning and midday prayer as a family, and then just looked for shade and breezes. We’re catching up on our ‘Fellowship of the Ring’ readings which have fallen off a bit in days of travel and outings (which we’ll have to get caught up on blogging at some point, too).  
<br><br>
So I’m eager to see what else the Lord has in store for us in our time here, even as we pray for some break in the heat. It did cool off during the night decently, so at least we were able to sleep alright. 
<br><br>
Thanks for following our journeys. To our friends and families, be assured we continue to pray for you and think of you often.
		The thought of returning home is beginning to sound good to us (even as we look forward to heading on to Switzerland on Sunday).</p>
<br><br>
P.S. Additional Update from Saturday - Thanks be to God, after some rain in the night and clouds today, it's much cooler! And God has provided some encouraging and helpful things today. More stories to share later...!

        <p class = "entry-text">We made it safely to Amiens and are leaving again tomorrow. Our days have included worshipping in the cathedral in Ameins, visiting WW1 sites, visiting Paris, and surviving the heat. - Sarah <br><br> Today it is around 90 degrees farenheit. The cathedral was amazing. It is the largest cathedral in France (Bigger than the Notre Dame of Paris) In the picture you may notice that one of the towers is higher than the other.
		We do not know why. (Maybe halfway through building it they found out the Paris Notre Dame was higher and built the second tower higher to make theirs the tallest, I don't know) Anyway the cathedral was really cool even if we couldn't understand the service because it was all in french  -Elijah.</p>

        <p class = "entry-text">Yesterday we climbed up a really big fell called Winder. We had to go through some sheep pastures to get to the top. Once we got to the top we looked around. It was pretty. Then we split up.
<br>Mom and Esther went down but the rest of us went up even higher. It was incredible. You could see for miles and miles. 
<br>Then we went back down again. We hiked around until we were over the town of Sedbergh. Then we hiked to the bottom of the dale where we had icecream from a farm that makes their own incredible ice cream. Then we went back to Ingmire Hall and our spot in the Dovery. - Elijah</p>

        <p class = "entry-text">Last Days in Oxford
	<br><br>For those of you who checked earlier and couldn't understand this post: Sarah broke the blog, but Elijah has fixed it and so now you may read it. :)
		<br><br>On our last couple of days in Oxford, we were able to visit and see a few key Inklings’ locations.

<br><br>On Monday, we visited Magdalen (pronounced “Maudlin”) College. This is where CS Lewis taught for many years. We visited the chapel, listening to the organist practice while we looked around:

	 <p class = "entry-text">We walked together Addison’s Walk that is part of the college grounds. This is where C.S. Lewis once went for a long evening walk with J.R.R. Tolkien and another friend, Hugo Dyson. They discussed story, myth, faith, and history. The conversation continued in Lewis’ rooms far into the night. It was one of the key moments in Lewis becoming a Christian. The crucial realization for Lewis as he later put it, was that in Christianity, myth had become fact. All that he loved in mythic poetry and stories, so much of what he longed for and enjoyed in those stories, had occurred in history in Jesus. </p>

	 <p class = "entry-text">We then checked out where Lewis’ rooms were. This was where he stayed much of the time, hosted students. It’s also where the Inklings group gathered once a week in the evenings (we couldn’t get up into his rooms because they’re still used).

	 <p class = "entry-text">Next we took on the honored Oxford tradition of punting, eating our lunch on the river.</p>

	 <p class = "entry-text">Then on Tuesday, our last full day in Oxford, we visited the gravesite of both Lewis and Tolkien. 
<br>Lewis’ is in the churchyard cemetery of the parish church he attended. We read a poem that another Lewis’ lover wrote upon visiting this place and reading the line on the gravestone: “Men must endure their going hence.”</p>

	 	 <p class = "entry-text">Then we journeyed to the cemetery where Tolkien is buried with his wife, Edith. To understand the titles “Luthien” and “Beren” you need to read the story Tolkien wrote about these two characters. We paused to say a prayer at Tolkien’s grave, thanking God for these authors, their faith, their imagination, and the rich stories they wrote that continue to delight and encourage us.

	 	 <p class = "entry-text">Kids and Oma went home, and Darrin and Sarah went off to meet our friends, John and Mary Jo, for one more visit to the Eagle and Child. This is the other main gathering spot for the Inklings.

	 	 <p class = "entry-text">In the evening, I (Darrin) returned to Christ Church for an Evensong worship service led by the choir. When they sang the Nunc Dimittis (the Song of Simeon), it seemed a wonderfully fitting conclusion to the time in Oxford. The Lees and I then stopped by “The Mitre,” another pub where Lewis and Tolkien liked to meet.

<br><br>In all, much thanksgiving for two and a half weeks in this fascinating place. A lot of learning, many good conversations, beautiful architecture, and a lot of walks and bike rides around the town. And with it, a much more real sense of who these authors and story-tellers were, of the place that shaped them, and a sense of how their friendship spurred them to such imaginative faith and creativity. It’s not an easy place to take leave of. But we take a host of photos (just a sampling above), and many rich memories with us.

How did you get to class?
<br>Most mornings, I left early to attend morning prayers in the cathedral at Christ Church. That meant setting out on my noble steed, one of these fine “Pony Bikes.” For 10 pounds, I get unlimited rides for 30 days. The ride into class takes about 10 minutes, through a park, past some beautiful buildings, and down some back roads to Christ Church.</p>

	         <p class = "entry-text">What was morning prayers like?<br>
Lovely. About 8-12 people usually gathered in the side chapel here of the cathedral for Psalms and other Scripture readings, followed by, optionally, a short Communion service.

	         <p class = "entry-text">What was your class?<br>
I took a class  called “Heresy, Crusade, and Inquisition in Southern France from 1150-1250.” 
<br><br>
Really…? Um, how was it?<br>
Yes, really. It was…wait for it…great!
I was a bit nervous going in, not sure if it would sustain my interest for five days. But it turns out to be not only a fascinating period of history, but had a number of issues and areas that fascinated me.
<br><br>
Like what?<br>
I can name three quickly. I have a French name, that almost certainly came from Huguenots (French Protestants) and that history comes after this, but this was really interesting background. Two, it included the story of the Waldensians, a group that was doing Reformation 400 years before it began with Luther and Calvin and company. And third and related, it included way more theology than I thought, a chance to discuss with these classmates questions about God and Christian faith. Additionally, our tutor (professor, lecturer) was humorous, engaging, and kept the story moving.

	         <p class = "entry-text">What about food?<br>
Where to begin? The food was incredible. At times I thought I’d paid for a week of great meals in a beautiful setting and gotten some lectures thrown in. We ate in the dining hall at Christ Church. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, and it looks like the great hall at Hogwarts, that’s because it is, or nearly so. They modeled the Great Hall of the movies on this dining hall. I ate each lunch and dinner here for the week. And there were lots of good conversations with folks in the program from all over the world.

        <p class = "entry-text">Since Darrin took the computer to his class this week, we didn’t have a lot of opportunities to update the blog. So here are a few posts we’ve been meaning to do:
<br><br>First from Rebekah:
<br>We went to Blenheim Palace and saw some pretty cool things. First we saw the inside of the palace. We saw a lot of paintings and wherever we went through the palace we kept seeing things about the 1st Duke of Marlborough winning a battle against the French. That was why he was made a duke and given this palace. We saw a vast collection of tiny toy soldiers. We went there with Ms. Mary Jo, but Dad didn’t come since he was at his class with Mr. John.

		        <p class = "entry-text">There was a really cool organ in the long library. It was ginormous. Back in the time of WWII, boys lived in the library like a dormitory. After they left again they found that the three smallest pipes were missing. They replaced them and didn’t think anything else about them. Many years later they got an anonymous envelope in the mail and it was the wife of someone who had lived in the dormitory and one of his wishes for when he died was for the pipes he had stolen as a kid be returned. They never found out who it was.

A little more from Esther: “First we went to the Tower of London and we saw the Crown Jewels. It was really pretty. There was a really cool sword and cape and crown. We saw the tower ravens.  One of the ravens was named Jubilee. 
Then we walked across Tower Bridge. In fact we did a 3D puzzle of Tower Bridge at home. It was really cool to see it.
<br>We saw Big Ben but it was all covered with scaffolding. And one of the worst things of all was we went in a really hot, hot, hot bus. 
<br>We went to Kensington Gardens and we saw the Peter Pan statue and there was a round about of water that we went into with our clothing and splashed around. One of the best parts."

		<br><br>
Today we went to the Ancient Roman baths in Bath, UK.  It was really cool. In the pictures below there is a glass model of the Roman baths. The water came up out of the hot springs and flows around to each pool. They thought the spring was very sacred. We could see the water bubbling. They believed that was the goddess breathing under water. </p>

        <p class = "entry-text" id ="England">An Update from Oxford 
<br><br>
We’re here! 
		<br>
Okay, we’ve actually been here for a couple days now. We arrived on Saturday evening after a long day of travel. Bus - two trains - and then taxis - to get to our lodging. Our lodging is “The White House” which is one half of a duplex (the other half is “The Gray House”).  The owners met us as we arrived and hospitably showed us around. It’s a very adequate and cozy three level with five bedrooms and 2.5 baths. It’s working out great.
<br><br>
On Sunday, we found our way to an evangelical Anglican Church meeting in Oxford, Saint Ebbe’s (stebbes.org). It’s a vibrant, intergenerational church. The welcome was warm and the worship was rich and beautiful. It was a delight, and though we only have three Sundays here, we think we’ll be back. The sermon was fittingly on Sabbath and rest in a world of restlessness. </p>

</a>

	  <p class = "entry-text">We meandered back through the city center and major sites of Oxford. “The White House” is a 25-30 minute walk from the City Center. 
<br><br>
In the evening, Sarah and I went out for dinner. Saturday was our 17th Anniversary. We walked to “The Eagle and Child,” the pub most well known as the frequent gathering place for the Inklings (often called by them “The Bird and Baby”). Having heard of it and seen pictures often, it was a delight just to see it in person.

	  <p class = "entry-text">Unfortunately, they were “all out of food” by the time we arrived. So we went to a little French restaurant around the corner that had been recommended. That was good, too.
<br><br>
Today, I went off to walk more of the city and get the lay of the land. It’s rather labyrinthine, and there are so many impressive buildings, and so much history, it’s rather overwhelming. But it is rather enchanting and beautiful, and I’m starting to get my bearings. There are key sites related to Lewis and Tolkien, as well as key sites of the Reformation in England. Having located some of these, I’m looking forward to doing a family tour one of these days.</p>

		  <p class = "entry-text">I stopped by the famous Blackwell book store, perused for a while, then did some reading for the class I’ll be taking (next week) with a cappuccino and a really fine scone (with clotted cream and a little jar of jam). It was all pretty fantastic. </p>

</a>
	  <p class = "entry-text">I also toured the current exhibit of Tolkien items, highlighting especially his artistry of middle earth. It’s a fun exhibit, and gives a sense of his creativity and imagination in a different way from just seeing his writing. And of the long labor of love, diligence, and craft that it took to create Middle Earth and its stories.</p>

      <p class = "entry-text">It was really a great chance to explore. I’ve identified what’s where a bit and gotten a sense of where else I’d like to visit, and what things I’m eager for us to see as a family. 
<br><br>
A really good first couple days in Oxford. Thanks for your ongoing prayers for our health, safety, sleep, travel, and God’s guidance in our adventures. - Darrin

        <p class = "entry-text">An Update from Newlyn, Cornwall, England
<br><br>
First, a rundown of activities of the last days:
		<br><br>

Monday (6/25) - We went by train from Haarlem to Amsterdam, stuffed our luggage in lockers, and took a canal boat tour to the Rijks Museum. There we saw paintings by some of the Dutch masters - notably Rembrandt and Vermeer. Then we got back on the canal boat to the train station, gathered our things, and were off on a train heading for the coast.
</p>

</a>
<br><br>	
		From that train to bus (just caught it) and to the boat awaiting us in the harbor in Hook of Holland, the overnight cruise to England. The boat departed at 10:30, and we hit the sack.

</a>
<br><br>
		Tuesday (6/26) - We disembarked at 6:30 am, having arrived in England! Then hopped right on the first train heading towards London. We arrived at Liverpool station about 9:30, had a bite to eat, and then navigated the subway system (not easy with 7 of us and all our luggage) to get to Paddington Station. From Paddington we found our train to Penzance, a nearly six hour train ride. Then a short bus ride to the nearby town of Newlyn, and a walk over a bridge and up a hill…and our final destination at last. Wonderfully, this cottage is all we could have hoped for - cozy, charming, quiet, clean. A great place to rest, and rest our most pressing need.
<br><br>	
Wednesday (6/27) - We took it real easy Wednesday. Settling in, finding groceries, playing games, reading. Cornish pasties for supper.
<br><br>
		Thursday (6/28) - We’ve just gotten back from a visit to Saint Michael’s Mount, a short bus ride away. What a magnificent and beautiful place - island mountain in the bay with a castle and beautiful gardens. We just made it over the causeway before the tide came in and then time on the beach.

An Interview with Rebekah:
<br><br>
<strong>How was flying for the first time?</strong>
I didn’t really like sleeping through the night. It didn’t work too well. But I really liked it for the most part. Lifting off was really fun…and scary.
<br><br>
<strong>Tell us something interesting you’ve learned so far:</strong>
Learning about where my great-great-great Opa and Oma lived and seeing where they lived.
<br><br>
<strong>What’s something different from the United States that you’ve noticed:</strong>
There are way more bicycles here, and transportation is a lot less built on cars.
<br><br>
<strong>What do you most remember from the Corie Ten Boom House?</strong>
Wow. There’s a lot. She and her family made watches. And she hid a bunch of people and helped them get to places they could hide better. And after the war, she forgave a lot of people, including the guards from the concentration camp she was held in.
<br><br>
<strong>What would you want to share about the windmill we saw?</strong>
It pumped water over the dykes, and stopped working in 1924. And the people who are there have re-put in everything.
<br><br>
<strong>How’s the food so far?</strong>
I don’t really like the raw fish (herring) but I did like the croquettes.
<br><br>
<strong>What are you most thankful for from the trip so far?</strong>
Being here in the Netherlands and that we got to travel.
<br><br>

        <p class = "entry-text">

I’m at Day 3 of a conference being held at Wheaton College (Chicago) called “Communicating the Gospel, C.S. Lewis Style.” <br><br>

We managed to insert this into our plans when learning of it some months ago, squeezing it in before our flight off to Europe. I didn’t know much about the organization putting it on or the speakers. So I didn’t know just what to expect, except that gathering with others who love Lewis and his writings would be interesting.<br><br>

The conference has been a real joy. Wonderfully, these are not just folks who love Lewis (and Tolkien, and others such), but who love Christ and the Gospel. The lead speaker, Dr. Jerry Root, has been a wealth of wisdom, humor, and insights. The days have been long, but very full, of good learning and meaningful conversations. I have lots of notes, and lots of thoughts to process yet. <br><br>

I’ve been coming to a fresh appreciation why Lewis’ writings, especially his stories like the Narnian Chronicles, have been so helpful in my own faith, so joy-giving in the reading and re-reading, and so valuable as a father, pastor, and preacher of the Gospel.<br><br>

So I’m very thankful. Tomorrow, Sarah and kids come. I’ll get to show them some of the wonderful items at the Wade Center where the conference has been held - things like Lewis’ writing desk, and also Tolkien’s. And also, wonderfully, the wardrobe carved by Lewis’ grandfather and which he and his brother played in as children. And that on the day we step through the wardrobe that is the wonder of plane travel, zipping off to what is basically for us another world on the other side of the ocean. Pictures to come…<br><br>

Thanks for your continued love and prayers as we continue the journey. - Darrin</p>

        <p class = "entry-text">We made it back home. We had a fantastic last day at Cedar Campus. We hiked back to Gnome Rock with the DeYoungs, saw another porcupine, had a campfire with hotdogs and s’mores for lunch, kayaked more, played Nuke-em (ask the kids), found just hatched water snakes that looked like string, and played many games. 
<br><br>Esther’s cold started to develop into wheezing which made us a little nervous. Darrin started remembering his struggles with asthma as a kid and didn’t want to see Esther go through that. After a phone call to a great doctor uncle with good calming advice, an interrupted night of sleep, a smooth ride home, a visit to the doctor with a diagnosis of bronchitis, and good meds, Esther is her energetic, silly self again. We are grateful to Uncle Dick and God’s healing power. 
<br><br>Darrin now gets one day of packing and heads to Chicago on Sunday. - Sarah</p>

        <p class = "entry-text">On Tuesday, we went kayaking. Which was my favorite part. We always ride “The Floating Bear” to breakfast and supper, but not lunch (which we eat on our own in our cabin). 

On Tuesday night, the DeYoungs came. They are our friends. We love playing with Luke, John, and Samuel. We like playing “We Didn’t Playtest This At All” (a silly card game found in our cabin). And to hike with them and do lots of other things.

Yesterday, at the start of the day, it was rainy. It was thunder and lightning. After it stopped, we went out hiking on the Narnia trail with the DeYoungs. And when we were coming back it poured rain. We took hot showers when we got back to our cabin. 

And today, it is beautiful. It is breezy and sunny, and no clouds in the sky. Today I’m excited about waterfront time and more kayaking. - Esther</p>

We got to Cedar Campus on Friday. We had cleaned the house and packed for coming. After we came, we explored our whole cabin. Esther and Bekah had lots of fun running around. We picked our bedrooms. Mom and Dad got a bedroom with a window seat. Me and Eli got the bedroom looking out on the bay. And Esther and Bekah got the room looking into the woods.<br><br>

Yesterday, we explored. We found the basketball hoops. We hiked the Narnia Trail, and waded in the water. We climbed up on a huge rock and Daddy and Mom read The Hobbit. And we road “The Floating Bear” (the ferry across the bay) to supper (where the dining hall is from our cabin). After supper, we played on a playground of boats for a while. Then we rode “The Floating Bear” back. <br><br>

My favorite thing of being at Cedar Campus so far is everything. - Hannah

        <p class = "entry-text">Today we leave for Cedar Campus. Preparations are going on as I write this.
			<br>Speaking of preparations, on Tuesday we handed over the chickens for the summer. It was a little sad but exciting too.
			They didn't seem to want to go. We didn't really want them to go either. It's exciting, though, knowing that in only <em><strong>13</em></strong> days we fly to Europe. - Elijah</p>

        <p class = "entry-text">Last week I visited  The Hermitage (www.hermitagecommunity.org) in Three Rivers, Michigan. It was a four day retreat with a focus on rest and prayer. It gave space and time to reflect on the last season of ministry, and to mark the transition to this Summer with all it’s plans and possibilities.<br>

The time was very good. Each morning I gathered with others for Morning Prayers. I met with one of the directors there, David, for about an hour to talk and pray together through how God was leading me through this time. And then the days were spent in a rhythm of rest, reading, meals, and walks around the grounds. One of the big themes was just slowing down, like riding a bike and working down through the gears, feathering the brakes. It takes time to slow down. And then, after a couple of days of that, I found, wonderfully, it had happened. I felt…rested. My mind seemed less scattered. I could read for more than 20 minutes without falling asleep (and without coffee). I felt ready…to get moving again. Which is good because there will be a lot of being on the move this summer.<br>

One of the delightful surprises was digging into a book that had been pointed out to us recently. In Search of Deep Faith: A Pilgrimage Into the Beauty, Goodness and Heart of Christianity, Jim Belcher, who is a pastor, shares of taking a sabbatical break with wife and four children, and traveling to Oxford as a pilgrimage of learning and spiritual growth. (Here’s a nice video on the part of their trip where they visit C.S. Lewis’ Oxford home: www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQnJ9BQgzXs).<br>

The parallels with our own summer plans gave the chance to think through how God has prompted and guided us to a similar kind of journey this summer. <br> 

This week we’re home. Catching a couple of baseball games. Making final preparations and packing. Tying up loose ends. Yet still resting, too. And getting ready to gear up in a whole different way. The next leg will be to Cedar Campus in Michigan’s U.P. <br>

Thanks for your ongoing prayers on our behalf. 

	- Darrin</p>

    <h3 class = "entry-date" id ="overview">Pastoral Sabbatical 2018 Overview
</h3>
        <p class = "description entry-text" >Description:<br>
The theme developed for the the Sabbatical comes from the friendship and writings of “The Inklings,”
		a group featuring most prominently C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.
                The key idea is to explore what in their friendship helped them to not only stay faithful as followers of Christ,
		but to do so with such abundant imagination and overflowing creativity that gave,
		and continues to give through their writings, joy and hope to so many.<br>

This sabbatical involves spending time with their works and those who’ve studied them,
		as well as seeking out the sources of their rich friendship in travel, learning and adventure.
		And doing all this so that our joy and delight is deepened in sharing the Gospel and sharing our lives.
Our original Sabbatical plans have had to be somewhat flexible as we’ve looked to turn them into reality.
		Some things we thought would work great turned out not to.<br> 
		The family camp we’d looked into was booked by the time we learned of the grant’s approval,
		for example.<br> 

But other possibilities opened up before us that fit the themes and purpose of the Sabbatical beautifully.
		Some of this is still in development, but we can now paint a fairly full picture of what we
		anticipate the summer looking like.<br>

——————————————————————-<br>

Timeline and Plans:<br>

		<strong>May 20</strong> - Pentecost - Last Sunday of leading worship prior to Sabbatical<br>
<br>
<strong>May 21-June 7</strong>   -   Theme: “The Shire: Preparing”<br> 
We’ll be mostly at home for these days, catching our breath, tidying, and getting ready for the summer ahead.
		Pastor Darrin will take a 3-day spiritual retreat to The Hermitage (Three Rivers)
		for a time of rest and prayer. And we’ll look to connect with family and friends ahead
		of our weeks of travel.<br>
	<br>
		<strong>June 8-15</strong>   -   Theme: “Rivendell (Part I): Explore, Play, Rest, Friendships” 
For these weeks we’ll get ready and head as a family to Cedar Campus in Michigan’s Upper peninsula.
		<img class = "entry-pic intro-quote" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d0/71/ef/d071ef40a1ec68bcf2672d622d48b3b6--memes.jpg" ></img>
	    We’ll begin some of our summer reading together of Lewis and Tolkien’s key works,
	    and for the last few days of our time there some good friends of ours will come to spend a few days with us.<br>
<br>
<strong>June 16-20</strong>   -   Theme:  “The Road Towards Lothlorien: Gathering Wisdom”<br>
Pastor Darrin will go with friend and colleague Pastor John Lee and his wife,
	    Mary Jo, to Wheaton College (Chicago) for a conference of the C.S. Lewis Society.
	    The conference’s theme is “Communicating the Gospel C.S. Lewis Style.” <br>
	<br>
<strong>June 21-July 21</strong>   -   Theme: “Lothlorien: Study the Sources, Friendships”<br>
The Compagner family will travel (accompanied by Sarah’s mother) to England.
	    Our flights will take us to Amsterdam where we’ll take advantage of a couple days
	    to explore some sites of family and historical interest.
	    We’ll then go via train and ship to the UK, beginning with some days in the Cornwall region
	    (South West England) whose seascapes inspired some of Lewis’ and Tolkiens’ writings. 

We’ll then head  to Oxford (image below left) for a few weeks (where we will reconnect with the Lees),
	    and Pastor Darrin will take a class at Oxford University (the course’s title:
	    “Heresy, Crusade and Inquisition in Southern France, 1150-1250”).<br>
 
We look forward to walking the town, visiting C.S. Lewis’ Oxford home
	    (“The Kilns”), and visiting the pub (“The Eagle and Child”) where the Inklings gathered
	    to share their readings and conversations. Various day trips to London or other sites are likely.
	    We’ll conclude our time in England with a few days traveling North to the Lakes District. <br>
<br>
<strong>July 22-August 3</strong>   -   Theme: “Minas Tirith: Travel, Adventure, Mountains”<br>
We’ll travel via train to France. Both Lewis and Tolkien fought in World War I, and we plan to visit some of the key
	    historical locations that shaped their lives and writings in northern France.
	    We’ll then work our way south towards Switzerland. We have a tentative visit to Taize 
	    (a Christian monastic community that welcomes visitors from all over the world) in our plans.
	    We’ll then head to Switzerland for time of hiking and exploring some of the territory that
	    helped to inspire Tolkien’s creation of Middle Earth.<br>
<br>
<strong>August 4-18</strong>   -   Theme: “Rivendell (Part II): Explore, Play, Rest”<br>
We’ll stay at Credo Castle, a Christian ministry that will serve as a base for hikes and exploring in Switzerland.
	    Credo sits at the base of Lauterbrunnen Valley (image below right) which was the key inspiration for
	    Tolkien’s Rivendell.<br>
<br>
<strong>August 19-25</strong>   -   Theme: “Back to the Shire: Returning Slowly”<br>
Arriving home and catching our breath, Pastor Darrin has (tentative) plans to visit the Hermitage
	    for a closing time of prayer and thanksgiving for the sabbatical. Then we’ll resume life and responsibilities,
	    returning to work on August 26 and to preaching and leading worship on September 2.<br>

<br>
——————————————————————-<br>

This all feels somewhat like a dream to us. We are very grateful for Blythefield’s Sabbatical Policy,
	    for the council’s encouragement, and the congregation’s blessing in making this all possible.
	    We’re very grateful for the grant through Clergy Renewal Program that is providing funds to make travel
	    together as a family possible in ways we could barely have otherwise imagined.<br> 

And we’re truly hopeful that this time of rest, travel, study, friendship, and adventure will not only nourish
	    us as a family, but will overflow in surprising gifts and blessings for you as our church family, too.</p>
