        <p class = "entry-text">June 28 - An Update from Newlyn, Cornwall, England

First, a rundown of activities of the last days:

Monday (6/25) - We went by train from Haarlem to Amsterdam, stuffed our luggage in lockers, and took a canal boat tour to the Rijks Museum. There we saw paintings by some of the Dutch masters - notably Rembrandt and Vermeer. Then we got back on the canal boat to the train station, gathered our things, and were off on a boat heading for the coast.

From that train to bus (just caught it) and to the boat awaiting us in the harbor in Hook of Holland, the overnight cruise to England. The boat departed at 10:30, and we hit the sack.

Tuesday (6/26) - We disembarked at 6:30 am, having arrived in England! Then hopped right on the first train heading towards Amsterdam. We arrived in Amsterdam station about 9:30, had a bite to eat, and then navigated the subway system (not easy with 7 of us and all our luggage) to get to Paddington Station. From Paddington we found our train to Penzance, a nearly six hour train ride. Then a short bus ride to the nearby town of Newlyn, and a walk over a bridge and up a hill…and our final destination at last. Wonderfully, this cottage is all we could have hoped for - cozy, charming, quiet, clean. A great place to rest, and rest our most pressing need.

Wednesday (6/27) - We took it real easy Wednesday. Settling in, finding groceries, playing games, reading. Cornish pasties for supper.

Thursday (6/28) - We’ve just gotten back from a visit to Saint Michael’s Mount, a short bus ride away. What a magnificent and beautiful place - island mountain in the bay, a castle, beautiful gardens, and time on the beach.

An Interview with Rebekah:
<br><br>
<strong>How was flying for the first time?</strong>
I didn’t really like sleeping through the night. It didn’t work too well. But I really liked it for the most part. Lifting off was really fun…and scary.
<br><br>
<strong>Tell us something interesting you’ve learned so far:</strong>
Learning about where my great-great-great Opa and Oma lived and seeing where they lived.
<br><br>
<strong>What’s something different from the United States that you’ve noticed:</strong>
There are way more bicycles here, and transpiration is a lot less built on cars.
<br><br>
<strong>What do you most remember from the Corie Ten Boom House?</strong>
Wow. There’s a lot. She and her family made watches. And she hid a bunch of people and helped them get to places they could hide better. And after the war, she forgave a lot of people, including the guards from the concentration camp she was held in.
<br><br>
<strong>What would you want to share about the windmill we saw?</strong>
It pumped water over the dykes, and stopped working in 1924. And the people who are there have re-put in everything.
<br><br>
<strong>How’s the food so far?</strong>
I don’t really like the raw fish (herring) but I did like the croquettes.
<br><br>
<strong>What are you most thankful for from the trip so far?</strong>
Being here in the Netherlands and that we got to travel.
<br><br>

        <p class = "entry-text">

I’m at Day 3 of a conference being held at Wheaton College (Chicago) called “Communicating the Gospel, C.S. Lewis Style.” <br><br>

We managed to insert this into our plans when learning of it some months ago, squeezing it in before our flight off to Europe. I didn’t know much about the organization putting it on or the speakers. So I didn’t know just what to expect, except that gathering with others who love Lewis and his writings would be interesting.<br><br>

The conference has been a real joy. Wonderfully, these are not just folks who love Lewis (and Tolkien, and others such), but who love Christ and the Gospel. The lead speaker, Dr. Jerry Root, has been a wealth of wisdom, humor, and insights. The days have been long, but very full, of good learning and meaningful conversations. I have lots of notes, and lots of thoughts to process yet. <br><br>

I’ve been coming to a fresh appreciation why Lewis’ writings, especially his stories like the Narnian Chronicles, have been so helpful in my own faith, so joy-giving in the reading and re-reading, and so valuable as a father, pastor, and preacher of the Gospel.<br><br>

So I’m very thankful. Tomorrow, Sarah and kids come. I’ll get to show them some of the wonderful items at the Wade Center where the conference has been held - things like Lewis’ writing desk, and also Tolkien’s. And also, wonderfully, the wardrobe carved by Lewis’ grandfather and which he and his brother played in as children. And that on the day we step through the wardrobe that is the wonder of plane travel, zipping off to what is basically for us another world on the other side of the ocean. Pictures to come…<br><br>

Thanks for your continued love and prayers as we continue the journey. - Darrin</p>

        <p class = "entry-text">We made it back home. We had a fantastic last day at Cedar Campus. We hiked back to Gnome Rock with the DeYoungs, saw another porcupine, had a campfire with hotdogs and s’mores for lunch, kayaked more, played Nuke-em (ask the kids), found just hatched water snakes that looked like string, and played many games. 
<br><br>Esther’s cold started to develop into wheezing which made us a little nervous. Darrin started remembering his struggles with asthma as a kid and didn’t want to see Esther go through that. After a phone call to a great doctor uncle with good calming advice, an interrupted night of sleep, a smooth ride home, a visit to the doctor with a diagnosis of bronchitis, and good meds, Esther is her energetic, silly self again. We are grateful to Uncle Dick and God’s healing power. 
<br><br>Darrin now gets one day of packing and heads to Chicago on Sunday. - Sarah</p>

        <p class = "entry-text">On Tuesday, we went kayaking. Which was my favorite part. We always ride “The Floating Bear” to breakfast and supper, but not lunch (which we eat on our own in our cabin). 

On Tuesday night, the DeYoungs came. They are our friends. We love playing with Luke, John, and Samuel. We like playing “We Didn’t Playtest This At All” (a silly card game found in our cabin). And to hike with them and do lots of other things.

Yesterday, at the start of the day, it was rainy. It was thunder and lightning. After it stopped, we went out hiking on the Narnia trail with the DeYoungs. And when we were coming back it poured rain. We took hot showers when we got back to our cabin. 

And today, it is beautiful. It is breezy and sunny, and no clouds in the sky. Today I’m excited about waterfront time and more kayaking. - Esther</p>

We got to Cedar Campus on Friday. We had cleaned the house and packed for coming. After we came, we explored our whole cabin. Esther and Bekah had lots of fun running around. We picked our bedrooms. Mom and Dad got a bedroom with a window seat. Me and Eli got the bedroom looking out on the bay. And Esther and Bekah got the room looking into the woods.<br><br>

Yesterday, we explored. We found the basketball hoops. We hiked the Narnia Trail, and waded in the water. We climbed up on a huge rock and Daddy and Mom read The Hobbit. And we road “The Floating Bear” (the ferry across the bay) to supper (where the dining hall is from our cabin). After supper, we played on a playground of boats for a while. Then we rode “The Floating Bear” back. <br><br>

My favorite thing of being at Cedar Campus so far is everything. - Hannah

        <p class = "entry-text">Today we leave for Cedar Campus. Preparations are going on as I write this.
			<br>Speaking of preparations, on Tuesday we handed over the chickens for the summer. It was a little sad but exciting too.
			They didn't seem to want to go. We didn't really want them to go either. It's exciting, though, knowing that in only <em><strong>13</em></strong> days we fly to Europe. - Elijah</p>

        <p class = "entry-text">Last week I visited  The Hermitage (www.hermitagecommunity.org) in Three Rivers, Michigan. It was a four day retreat with a focus on rest and prayer. It gave space and time to reflect on the last season of ministry, and to mark the transition to this Summer with all it’s plans and possibilities.<br>

The time was very good. Each morning I gathered with others for Morning Prayers. I met with one of the directors there, David, for about an hour to talk and pray together through how God was leading me through this time. And then the days were spent in a rhythm of rest, reading, meals, and walks around the grounds. One of the big themes was just slowing down, like riding a bike and working down through the gears, feathering the brakes. It takes time to slow down. And then, after a couple of days of that, I found, wonderfully, it had happened. I felt…rested. My mind seemed less scattered. I could read for more than 20 minutes without falling asleep (and without coffee). I felt ready…to get moving again. Which is good because there will be a lot of being on the move this summer.<br>

One of the delightful surprises was digging into a book that had been pointed out to us recently. In Search of Deep Faith: A Pilgrimage Into the Beauty, Goodness and Heart of Christianity, Jim Belcher, who is a pastor, shares of taking a sabbatical break with wife and four children, and traveling to Oxford as a pilgrimage of learning and spiritual growth. (Here’s a nice video on the part of their trip where they visit C.S. Lewis’ Oxford home: www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQnJ9BQgzXs).<br>

The parallels with our own summer plans gave the chance to think through how God has prompted and guided us to a similar kind of journey this summer. <br> 

This week we’re home. Catching a couple of baseball games. Making final preparations and packing. Tying up loose ends. Yet still resting, too. And getting ready to gear up in a whole different way. The next leg will be to Cedar Campus in Michigan’s U.P. <br>

Thanks for your ongoing prayers on our behalf. 

	- Darrin</p>

    <h3 class = "entry-date" id ="overview">Pastoral Sabbatical 2018 Overview
</h3>
        <p class = "description entry-text" >Description:<br>
The theme developed for the the Sabbatical comes from the friendship and writings of “The Inklings,”
		a group featuring most prominently C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.
                The key idea is to explore what in their friendship helped them to not only stay faithful as followers of Christ,
		but to do so with such abundant imagination and overflowing creativity that gave,
		and continues to give through their writings, joy and hope to so many.<br>

This sabbatical involves spending time with their works and those who’ve studied them,
		as well as seeking out the sources of their rich friendship in travel, learning and adventure.
		And doing all this so that our joy and delight is deepened in sharing the Gospel and sharing our lives.
Our original Sabbatical plans have had to be somewhat flexible as we’ve looked to turn them into reality.
		Some things we thought would work great turned out not to.<br> 
		The family camp we’d looked into was booked by the time we learned of the grant’s approval,
		for example.<br> 

But other possibilities opened up before us that fit the themes and purpose of the Sabbatical beautifully.
		Some of this is still in development, but we can now paint a fairly full picture of what we
		anticipate the summer looking like.<br>

——————————————————————-<br>

Timeline and Plans:<br>

		<strong>May 20</strong> - Pentecost - Last Sunday of leading worship prior to Sabbatical<br>
<br>
<strong>May 21-June 7</strong>   -   Theme: “The Shire: Preparing”<br> 
We’ll be mostly at home for these days, catching our breath, tidying, and getting ready for the summer ahead.
		Pastor Darrin will take a 3-day spiritual retreat to The Hermitage (Three Rivers)
		for a time of rest and prayer. And we’ll look to connect with family and friends ahead
		of our weeks of travel.<br>
	<br>
		<strong>June 8-15</strong>   -   Theme: “Rivendell (Part I): Explore, Play, Rest, Friendships” 
For these weeks we’ll get ready and head as a family to Cedar Campus in Michigan’s Upper peninsula.
		<img class = "entry-pic intro-quote" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/d0/71/ef/d071ef40a1ec68bcf2672d622d48b3b6--memes.jpg" ></img>
	    We’ll begin some of our summer reading together of Lewis and Tolkien’s key works,
	    and for the last few days of our time there some good friends of ours will come to spend a few days with us.<br>
<br>
<strong>June 16-20</strong>   -   Theme:  “The Road Towards Lothlorien: Gathering Wisdom”<br>
Pastor Darrin will go with friend and colleague Pastor John Lee and his wife,
	    Mary Jo, to Wheaton College (Chicago) for a conference of the C.S. Lewis Society.
	    The conference’s theme is “Communicating the Gospel C.S. Lewis Style.” <br>
	<br>
<strong>June 21-July 21</strong>   -   Theme: “Lothlorien: Study the Sources, Friendships”<br>
The Compagner family will travel (accompanied by Sarah’s mother) to England.
	    Our flights will take us to Amsterdam where we’ll take advantage of a couple days
	    to explore some sites of family and historical interest.
	    We’ll then go via train and ship to the UK, beginning with some days in the Cornwall region
	    (South West England) whose seascapes inspired some of Lewis’ and Tolkiens’ writings. 

We’ll then head  to Oxford (image below left) for a few weeks (where we will reconnect with the Lees),
	    and Pastor Darrin will take a class at Oxford University (the course’s title:
	    “Heresy, Crusade and Inquisition in Southern France, 1150-1250”).<br>
 
We look forward to walking the town, visiting C.S. Lewis’ Oxford home
	    (“The Kilns”), and visiting the pub (“The Eagle and Child”) where the Inklings gathered
	    to share their readings and conversations. Various day trips to London or other sites are likely.
	    We’ll conclude our time in England with a few days traveling North to the Lakes District. <br>
<br>
<strong>July 22-August 3</strong>   -   Theme: “Minas Tirith: Travel, Adventure, Mountains”<br>
We’ll travel via train to France. Both Lewis and Tolkien fought in World War I, and we plan to visit some of the key
	    historical locations that shaped their lives and writings in northern France.
	    We’ll then work our way south towards Switzerland. We have a tentative visit to Taize 
	    (a Christian monastic community that welcomes visitors from all over the world) in our plans.
	    We’ll then head to Switzerland for time of hiking and exploring some of the territory that
	    helped to inspire Tolkien’s creation of Middle Earth.<br>
<br>
<strong>August 4-18</strong>   -   Theme: “Rivendell (Part II): Explore, Play, Rest”<br>
We’ll stay at Credo Castle, a Christian ministry that will serve as a base for hikes and exploring in Switzerland.
	    Credo sits at the base of Lauterbrunnen Valley (image below right) which was the key inspiration for
	    Tolkien’s Rivendell.<br>
<br>
<strong>August 19-25</strong>   -   Theme: “Back to the Shire: Returning Slowly”<br>
Arriving home and catching our breath, Pastor Darrin has (tentative) plans to visit the Hermitage
	    for a closing time of prayer and thanksgiving for the sabbatical. Then we’ll resume life and responsibilities,
	    returning to work on August 26 and to preaching and leading worship on September 2.<br>

<br>
——————————————————————-<br>

This all feels somewhat like a dream to us. We are very grateful for Blythefield’s Sabbatical Policy,
	    for the council’s encouragement, and the congregation’s blessing in making this all possible.
	    We’re very grateful for the grant through Clergy Renewal Program that is providing funds to make travel
	    together as a family possible in ways we could barely have otherwise imagined.<br> 

And we’re truly hopeful that this time of rest, travel, study, friendship, and adventure will not only nourish
	    us as a family, but will overflow in surprising gifts and blessings for you as our church family, too.</p>
