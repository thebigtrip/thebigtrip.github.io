</h3>
        <p class = "description" >Description:<br>
The theme developed for the the Sabbatical comes from the friendship and writings of “The Inklings,”
		a group featuring most prominently C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien.
                The key idea is to explore what in their friendship helped them to not only stay faithful as followers of Christ,
		but to do so with such abundant imagination and overflowing creativity that gave,
		and continues to give through their writings, joy and hope to so many.<br>

This sabbatical involves spending time with their works and those who’ve studied them,
		as well as seeking out the sources of their rich friendship in travel, learning and adventure.
		And doing all this so that our joy and delight is deepened in sharing the Gospel and sharing our lives.
Our original Sabbatical plans have had to be somewhat flexible as we’ve looked to turn them into reality.
		Some things we thought would work great turned out not to.<br> 
		The family camp we’d looked into was booked by the time we learned of the grant’s approval,
		for example.<br> 

But other possibilities opened up before us that fit the themes and purpose of the Sabbatical beautifully.
		Some of this is still in development, but we can now paint a fairly full picture of what we
		anticipate the summer looking like.<br>

——————————————————————-<br>

Timeline and Plans:<br>

		<strong>May 20</strong> - Pentecost - Last Sunday of leading worship prior to Sabbatical<br>
<br>
<strong>May 21-June 7</strong>   -   Theme: “The Shire: Preparing”<br> 
We’ll be mostly at home for these days, catching our breath, tidying, and getting ready for the summer ahead.
		Pastor Darrin will take a 3-day spiritual retreat to The Hermitage (Three Rivers)
		for a time of rest and prayer. And we’ll look to connect with family and friends ahead
		of our weeks of travel.<br>
	<br>
		<strong>June 8-15</strong>   -   Theme: “Rivendell (Part I): Explore, Play, Rest, Friendships” 
For these weeks we’ll get ready and head as a family to Cedar Campus in Michigan’s Upper peninsula.

	    We’ll begin some of our summer reading together of Lewis and Tolkien’s key works,
	    and for the last few days of our time there some good friends of ours will come to spend a few days with us.<br>
<br>
<strong>June 16-20</strong>   -   Theme:  “The Road Towards Lothlorien: Gathering Wisdom”<br>
Pastor Darrin will go with friend and colleague Pastor John Lee and his wife,
	    Mary Jo, to Wheaton College (Chicago) for a conference of the C.S. Lewis Society.
	    The conference’s theme is “Communicating the Gospel C.S. Lewis Style.” <br>
	<br>
<strong>June 21-July 21</strong>   -   Theme: “Lothlorien: Study the Sources, Friendships”<br>
The Compagner family will travel (accompanied by Sarah’s mother) to England.
	    Our flights will take us to Amsterdam where we’ll take advantage of a couple days
	    to explore some sites of family and historical interest.
	    We’ll then go via train and ship to the UK, beginning with some days in the Cornwall region
	    (South West England) whose seascapes inspired some of Lewis’ and Tolkiens’ writings. 

We’ll then head  to Oxford (image below left) for a few weeks (where we will reconnect with the Lees),
	    and Pastor Darrin will take a class at Oxford University (the course’s title:
	    “Heresy, Crusade and Inquisition in Southern France, 1150-1250”).<br>
 
We look forward to walking the town, visiting C.S. Lewis’ Oxford home
	    (“The Kilns”), and visiting the pub (“The Eagle and Child”) where the Inklings gathered
	    to share their readings and conversations. Various day trips to London or other sites are likely.
	    We’ll conclude our time in England with a few days traveling North to the Lakes District. <br>
<br>
<strong>July 22-August 3</strong>   -   Theme: “Minas Tirith: Travel, Adventure, Mountains”<br>
We’ll travel via train to France. Both Lewis and Tolkien fought in World War I, and we plan to visit some of the key
	    historical locations that shaped their lives and writings in northern France.
	    We’ll then work our way south towards Switzerland. We have a tentative visit to Taize 
	    (a Christian monastic community that welcomes visitors from all over the world) in our plans.
	    We’ll then head to Switzerland for time of hiking and exploring some of the territory that
	    helped to inspire Tolkien’s creation of Middle Earth.<br>
<br>
<strong>August 4-18</strong>   -   Theme: “Rivendell (Part II): Explore, Play, Rest”<br>
We’ll stay at Credo Castle, a Christian ministry that will serve as a base for hikes and exploring in Switzerland.
	    Credo sits at the base of Lauterbrunnen Valley (image below right) which was the key inspiration for
	    Tolkien’s Rivendell.<br>
<br>
<strong>August 19-25</strong>   -   Theme: “Back to the Shire: Returning Slowly”<br>
Arriving home and catching our breath, Pastor Darrin has (tentative) plans to visit the Hermitage
	    for a closing time of prayer and thanksgiving for the sabbatical. Then we’ll resume life and responsibilities,
	    returning to work on August 26 and to preaching and leading worship on September 2.<br>

<br>
——————————————————————-<br>

This all feels somewhat like a dream to us. We are very grateful for Blythefield’s Sabbatical Policy,
	    for the council’s encouragement, and the congregation’s blessing in making this all possible.
	    We’re very grateful for the grant through Clergy Renewal Program that is providing funds to make travel
	    together as a family possible in ways we could barely have otherwise imagined.<br> 

And we’re truly hopeful that this time of rest, travel, study, friendship, and adventure will not only nourish
	    us as a family, but will overflow in surprising gifts and blessings for you as our church family, too.</p>
